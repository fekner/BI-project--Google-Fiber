## Project Overview
The Cyclistic companyâ€™s Customer Growth Team is creating a business plan for next year. They want to understand how customers use their bikes; their top priority is identifying customer demand at different station locations.

## Datasets
Cyclistic has partnered with the city of New York to provide shared bikes.
1. Primary Dataset - [NYC Citi Bike Trips](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/city-of-new-york/nyc-citi-bike)
2. Secondary Dataset - [Census Bureau US Boundaries](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/united-states-census-bureau/us-geographic-boundaries)

## Approach

1. Project Planning
   - Information was gathered from notes taken at the last Cyclistic executive meeting.
   - Relevant stakeholders for each task were identified.
   - Tasks were organized into milestones.
   - Project planning documents were completed to align with stakeholders requirements.

The resulting documents are found in the Planning folder. 

2. Data Preparation
   - Project planning documents were used to identify key metrics and dashboard requirements.
   - Stakeholders were observed in action to better understand how they use data.
   - Necessary data was gathered and combined.
   - Reporting tables that could be uploaded to Tableau to create the final dashboard were designed.

The code created to merge the datasets into two target tables are found under the Code folder. 

3. Dashboard Design
   - The project planning documents were used to identify key metrics and dashboard requirements.
   - The two target tables were uploaded into Tableau.
   - Charts and tables were designed to be able to share insights with stakeholders.
   - Effective dashboards using the charts and tables was created.

The resulting dashboards with the main findings can be found in a post available at [tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/frida.ekner/viz/Cyclistic_17166727441900/Berttelse1).
